    "By now, you are given a secret signature consisting of character 'D' and 'I'. 'D' represents a decreasing relationship between two numbers, 'I' represents an increasing relationship between two numbers. And our secret signature was constructed by a special integer array, which contains uniquely all the different number from 1 to n (n is the length of the secret signature plus 1). For example, the secret signature \"DI\" can be constructed by array [2,1,3] or [3,1,2], but won't be constructed by array [3,2,4] or [2,1,3,4], which are both illegal constructing special string that can't represent the \"DI\" secret signature.\n",

    "On the other hand, now your job is to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of [1, 2, ... n] could refer to the given secret signature in the input.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: \"I\"\n",
    "Output: [1,2]\n",
    "Explanation: [1,2] is the only legal initial spectial string can construct secret signature \"I\", where the number 1 and 2 construct an increasing relationship.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: \"DI\"\n",
    "Output: [2,1,3]\n",
    "Explanation: Both [2,1,3] and [3,1,2] can construct the secret signature \"DI\", \n",
    "but since we want to find the one with the smallest lexicographical permutation, you need to output [2,1,3]\n",
    "Note:\n",
