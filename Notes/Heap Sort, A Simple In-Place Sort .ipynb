    "There are two ways of heapify, sift-up and sift-down. The sift-down approach starts from bottom to top. There are a lot of bottom items which requires just small number of operations. When approach top, the number of elements are greatly reduced and the number of operations will be close to log(n). The sift-up approach starts from top to bottom. The items close to top has few operations. When items close to bottom has close to log(n) operations and the number of bottom items is much larger. So sift-up approach is more time consuming than sift-approach.\n",
